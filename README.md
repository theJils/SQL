# SQL
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries that I wrote to interview tasks.
Each query is accompanied by a brief description of what it does. 

How to Use This Repository
To use this repository, simply download the SQL files to your local computer and open them in a SQL editor. 
You can then run the queries against your own database or against a public database.
